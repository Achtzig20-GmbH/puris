# Cross-cutting Concepts

## Multi-Partner Information

Within the supply network there may be materials / parts that are produced for multiple partners or customers that
share the same material number. 
A partner asking for information may not receive any information that are not meant for him. Therefor the PURIS concept
is, that exchanged information MUST be allocated to a partner to not leak any partner relationships in the vertical
direction.
